# 1 Week Wargame

A small turn-based tactics prototype built in Godot over the course of a week. Command units on a hex grid, outmaneuver the AI, and play short, punchy matches. Or watch the AI go at it.

## Highlights
- Hex-grid movement and combat
- Quick matches with simple rules
- Lightweight UI and sound effects

## Play

## Engine
